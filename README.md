# Description
# eyelighter
A basic difference between humans and other organisms is the curiousity to know about things. The bloom in the internet facilities has boosted this process of knowing and learning more and more about things, but there are couple of instances when we don't know what we are looking at! And trying to use text and keywords to describe something that is inherently visual is difficult and sometimes not recognised by search engine. In such situations a mode to search throuugh images is important. With aid of Machine Learning we intend to build an android application which can serve our purpose. keeping in mind the timeline of the project and team strength , we build this application for limited number of image datasets. We are trying to build an app to recognize the objects all around us
